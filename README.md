# Mini Square Firefox Nightly Theme

This is an attempt to extend life of my favorite Arc Darker gtk theme and its' perfect match [Arc Darker](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-firefox-theme) Firefox themes. I cloned one of those multiple clones of the original theme and tuned it a bit to my taste. Though I am using Firefox Nightly and it's interface is a subject of constant experiments, so I ended up with tracking my changes with git.
